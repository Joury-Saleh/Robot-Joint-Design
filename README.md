## Comparative Analysis

| Design | Max Stress (Pa) | Stress Reduction vs Design 1 | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------------|------------|---------------|
| Design 1 | 87,630 | Baseline (0%) | Simple manufacturing, Easy assembly | Highest stress concentrations, Potential failure points |
| Design 2 | 71,040 | 18.9% reduction | Better load distribution, Reinforced structure | More complex geometry, Additional material |
| Design 3 | 50,430 | 42.5% reduction | Lowest stress levels, Compact design, Best structural integrity | Most complex manufacturing, Limited accessibility |

## Results & Recommendations

### **Recommended Design: Design 3 (U-Shaped Joint)**

**Justification:**
1. **Superior Stress Performance**: 42.5% lower maximum stress compared to Design 1
2. **Better Safety Factor**: Lower stress levels provide higher safety margins
3. **Structural Efficiency**: Compact design with optimal load distribution
4. **Failure Resistance**: Reduced stress concentrations minimize crack initiation points

### Performance Ranking:
1. **Design 3** - Best overall performance (Lowest stress: 50,430 Pa)
2. **Design 2** - Good performance with moderate improvement (71,040 Pa)
3. **Design 1** - Baseline design requiring optimization (87,630 Pa)

## Material Properties (Aluminum)
- **Yield Strength**: ~276 MPa (276,000,000 Pa)
- **Ultimate Tensile Strength**: ~310 MPa
- **Young's Modulus**: ~69 GPa
- **Density**: 2,700 kg/mÂ³

## Safety Analysis
All designs show stress levels well below the yield strength of aluminum:
- Design 1: Safety Factor = 3,150
- Design 2: Safety Factor = 3,885
- Design 3: Safety Factor = 5,475

## Simulation Setup
- **Mesh Type**: Automatic mesh generation
- **Load Application**: Point load of 9.8 N
- **Boundary Conditions**: Fixed supports as shown in models & Force & Hinge constraint
- **Analysis Type**: Linear static analysis

## Conclusions
The FEA analysis clearly demonstrates that Design 3 offers the best mechanical performance with significantly reduced stress concentrations. While all designs are structurally safe under the applied load, Design 3 provides the highest safety margin and most robust solution for the intended application.
